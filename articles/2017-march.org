** Definitions
   - Logging: discrete events. Highest volume
   - Tracing: request scoped
   - Metrics: aggregatable. Lowest volume, given compressibility
*** As a Venn diagram, these three overlap consistently.
    - Logging / Tracing:  Request scoped events
    - Tracing / Metrics:  Request scoped metrics
    - Metrics / Logging:  Aggregable events
    - Metrics / Logging / Tracing: Request scoped, aggregatable events
*** Due to Tracing request scope, not all metrics or logs, for example, can be shoehorned into a tracing system
*** Shoehorning metrics into a logging pipeline may force us to abandon some advantages of a flexible query language to explore them.

  - Chickens are interesting collaborators
  - Often: Star performers become star performers by suppressing others (in chickens, which applies to people as well)
  - Red Zone vs Green Zone attitude:
    - Green Zone were healthy and productive chickens
    - Red Zone chickens murdered each other. More than half.
    - Egg production in greenzone +260%
  - Greenzone: Highly collaborative, blameless, less competition.
  - Can't compete externally, if you don't collaborate internally.
  - Biggest learning from CA teachers / labor unions studies
    - Nothing will help you become more productive and collaborative than: 
      - Managing your own defensiveness
        - It increases your ability to solve problems.
    - Green -> Red Zone is easy to move to based on small things (like crumbled up piece of paper)
  - Premise:
    Defensiveness does not protect us from other people.
    It defends us from fears we don't want to feel.
    - Potentially: Significance, competence, likeability
  - Defensiveness helps us hide our fears from ourselves.
  - Start paying attention to the outward behavior, as it's easier to
    identify and become an early warning system.
  - TODO: What makes _me_ feel defensive?
  - Signs of defensiveness: 
    - Withdrawal into deadly silence
    - Playing poor me
    - All or nothing thinking
    - Wanting to be right
    - Blaming or shaming others
    - Sudden drop in IQ/confusion
    - High charge of energy in the body
    - Catastrophizing everything
    - Wanting the last word
    - Obsessive thinking
    - Flooding with information to prove a point.
  - Create an early warning system
  - Then:
    - Acknowledge the defensiveness
    - Slow down the phisiology (take a walk, breathe)
    - Check negative self-talk (make it positive)
    - Create an ACTION STEP (e.g. be quiet for 15 seconds, instead of information flooding)
    - Start over.

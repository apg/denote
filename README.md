# denote

Back in high school I had a clever, dorky English teacher who was a
hard ass, but also someone I really adored. Well, one day, we were
discussing some SAT vocabulary words, one of which was "demise."

Now, as was typical, we'd talk about the definition and then use it
in a sentence. His sentence, which he then exploded into laughter after
sharing? "Demise ate the cheese."

That was likely the singly most important moment in my love of puns.

This repository isn't about puns. It's about notes. Of things I've
been reading (e.g. books, papers, articles), or conferences I've
attended, or talks I've listened to via audio or video.
